## 🧠 About the Projects

### 🎓 Classwork
The `classwork` folder contains hands-on exercises covering:
- Filtering and aggregating data
- Joining multiple tables
- Using common table expressions (CTEs)
- Grouping, window functions, and time-based analysis

Each `.sql` file reflects real-world-style problems with solutions I wrote as part of my learning journey.

### 🏭 Final Project – Intel Data Center Analysis
The `projects` folder contains the SQL scripts behind my final project: a full data analysis done in collaboration with Intel's Sustainability Team.

**Key Goals:**
- Identify energy-surplus regions for a new data center
- Compare renewable vs. fossil fuel generation
- Assess regional infrastructure using power plant data
- Recommend the optimal region based on energy and sustainability metrics

See the full breakdown and queries in the `documentation/Intel_Project_Solution.pdf`.
